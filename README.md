#  Image2BoxShadow
Saw someone make a Mona Lisa with CSS Boxshadow, so now here a generator for images. So here it is, because its fun and  its possible.

## Quick Setup
1. Clone the repo
2. cd image2boxshadow
3. php artisan serve
4. Goto 127.0.0.1:8080

I'm not responsible for your chrome that crashes when editing the CSS in element inspect, whuahah!!!
